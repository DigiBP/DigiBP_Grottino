# Dunder Mifflin AG
Our company specializes in selling high-quality paper. Our focus is to offer the best customer service in town. Our company headquarters is in Olten with offices in Basel, Bern, Zurich, and Geneva. We currently have 1 warehouse located in Olten. Due to the nature of our business, we not only have to provide excellent customer service, but also low prices. A lot of our processes are still done manually and this requires a lot of manhours. We are looking for innovative ways to digitalize our processes so that we can lower our operating costs and transfer the savings to our customers. If we continue doing our processes manually, we will not survive another year in business because our competitors are taking our clients.
